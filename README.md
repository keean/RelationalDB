Relational Algebra Library for JavaScript, provides an abstraction layer over javascript databases that allows the database schema to be specified declaratively in JavaScript, and then validates (or creates) the underlying database as appropriate. Operators are provided for Cobb's relational algebra on database tables, as well as the common ANSI SQL set, sorting, and grouping operators.

A Sample driver is provided for WebSQL, and the intention is that other drivers could be written for IndexedDB (for the client) or PostgreSQL (for Node.js), allowing a common declarative relational representation to be used on both client and server.
